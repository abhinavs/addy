- [ ] Parallel user operations when installing multiple users

## Documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common Git authentication issues
- [ ] Better examples for private repository setup
- [ ] Video walkthrough of basic setup

## Testing
- [ ] Integration tests with actual Git repositories
- [ ] Test coverage for error scenarios
